## About Me

I'm Daniel B. Christensen, a senior data engineer with over 7 years of experience designing and implementing mission-critical data pipelines and real-time data platforms. Currently working full-time with **The Walt Disney Company**, where I've improved event-based data query performance by 30% and significantly reduced Snowflake compute costs.

My expertise spans the entire data lifecycle‚Äîfrom ingestion and transformation to modeling and visualization. I've built sub-2-minute latency streaming infrastructures, managed ETL/ELT pipelines processing millions of records monthly, and architected FastAPI platforms handling 2M+ requests per month. I specialize in creating scalable, reliable systems using Python, Apache Airflow, Snowflake, FastAPI, and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure.

Beyond technical implementation, I bring leadership and mentorship to teams, optimizing workflows and delivering data solutions that drive measurable business value. My approach combines robust engineering practices with a focus on cost optimization, performance, and maintainability.

## Summary
I specialize in designing robust data pipelines, real-time streaming architectures, and full-stack analytics solutions. My work spans data ingestion, modeling, orchestration, cloud deployment, and visualization‚Äîdelivering end-to-end systems that power business intelligence and ML workflows.
