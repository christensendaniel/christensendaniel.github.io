# Hello World: Starting a Data Engineering Blog

*December 20, 2024*

## Why Start a Blog?

After 7+ years building data pipelines and platforms, I've accumulated countless lessons, patterns, and hard-won insights. This blog is my way of giving back to the data engineering community that has taught me so much.

## What I'll Write About

### Real-World Pipeline Challenges
I've built pipelines that process millions of records, handle real-time streaming data, and serve critical business needs. I'll share the challenges I've faced and how I've solved them—from dealing with late-arriving data to optimizing for cost without sacrificing performance.

### The Tools We Use
From Snowflake to BigQuery, Apache Airflow to custom orchestration, FastAPI to streaming platforms—I'll dive deep into the tools that power modern data infrastructure. Expect honest comparisons, migration guides, and optimization tips.

### Cost Optimization Stories
One of my proudest achievements at Disney was reducing Snowflake compute costs by 30%. I'll share specific techniques for cost optimization across different platforms, because efficient engineering isn't just about making things work—it's about making them sustainable.

### Career Growth in Data Engineering
Data engineering is evolving rapidly. I'll share insights on skill development, transitioning from analyst to engineer, and building the leadership skills that complement technical expertise.

## A Bit About My Journey

My path to data engineering wasn't traditional. With a degree in Economics from the University of Utah, I started by solving data problems at VIVBI, where I discovered my passion for building robust, scalable systems. 

Over the years, I've:
- Built a FastAPI platform handling 2M+ requests monthly
- Created real-time pipelines with sub-2-minute latency
- Integrated countless APIs, saving hundreds of hours of manual work
- Mentored engineers and led technical initiatives

Now at The Walt Disney Company, I'm working on some of the most interesting data challenges at scale, and I'm excited to share what I'm learning.

## What's Next?

In upcoming posts, I'll cover:
1. **"The Real Cost of Bad Data Models"** - A deep dive into query optimization
2. **"Building Your First Real-Time Pipeline"** - A practical guide with code
3. **"Airflow vs. Prefect vs. Dagster"** - An honest comparison from production experience

## Let's Connect

I believe in learning in public and building connections within our community. If you have questions, topics you'd like me to cover, or just want to chat about data engineering, reach out on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/dbchristensen).

Here's to building better data platforms, one pipeline at a time!
