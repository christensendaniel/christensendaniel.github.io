Welcome to my technical blog! I'm Daniel B. Christensen, a Senior Data Engineer at The Walt Disney Company, and I'm excited to share insights from my journey building data infrastructure at scale.

## Why This Blog?

After 7+ years in data engineering, I've accumulated knowledge that I believe can help others navigate the complex world of data pipelines, real-time processing, and cloud infrastructure. This blog will serve as a platform to share:

- **Technical deep-dives** into data engineering challenges and solutions
- **Best practices** for building scalable, maintainable data systems
- **Performance optimization** techniques that have saved companies millions
- **Real-world case studies** from my work at Disney, SAVVBI, and VIVBI

## What I've Been Working On

### Disney: Enterprise-Scale Real-Time Analytics

At Disney, I've been focused on building systems that can handle massive scale while maintaining sub-2-minute latency. Some highlights:

- **Performance Optimization**: Improved event-based data query performance by 30% through advanced Snowflake optimization
- **Cost Management**: Implemented comprehensive Snowflake cost reduction strategies
- **Real-Time Processing**: Built Apache Flink pipelines for streaming analytics
- **Data Modeling**: Created ML-ready data models with strict SLA adherence

### Key Technologies in My Stack

- **Streaming**: Apache Flink, Kafka, AWS Kinesis
- **Data Warehousing**: Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow with custom monitoring
- **APIs**: FastAPI for high-throughput data ingestion
- **Cloud**: AWS, Azure with infrastructure-as-code

## What's Coming

I'm planning to cover topics like:

1. **Building Sub-2-Minute Data Pipelines** - The architecture behind real-time analytics at scale
2. **Snowflake Cost Optimization** - How we reduced compute costs by 30% without sacrificing performance
3. **Apache Flink for Data Engineers** - Practical patterns for stream processing
4. **API-First Data Platforms** - Lessons from building systems that handle 2M+ requests/month
5. **Data Quality at Scale** - Monitoring and validation strategies for enterprise data
